  dialog:
  - actor: '5'
    text: It was only the far East, where untouched forests still covered the land,
      that withstood the advance of the Meshera. The people gave the Forest the name
      of "Vindale", meaning hope... And after many years, after the vast knowledge
      and culture of the previous human civilization had been lost, the Vindale Forest
      lived up to its name.
  - actor: '5'
    text: A massive immune reaction arose from the Forest, becoming a wind that raged
      across the world. Indeed, this is what we now know as the Ether Wind. The Ether
      Wind enhanced the natural immunity of the plant life that had been infected
      by the Meshera, massively weakening the Meshera infection. The Vindale Forest
      which produced the Ether Winds and the outside world where the Meshera had been
      weakened slowly began to differ from one another. That is the environment present
      in Ylva now.
  - actor: '5'
    text: With the arrival of the miracle of Vindale, the civilization of Rehm-Ido
      came to an end, and the era of Sierra Terre began... But humanity had painful
      times in their future. As time passed, some were born who could adapt to life
      outside of the Forest, and eventually, some who were born who were only capable
      of living outside the Forest. How that would turn out, you should well know.
  - actor: '5'
    text: '...That is the truth of the Forest. Should the Vindale Forest ever be destroyed,
      the Ether Winds will cease. Eventually the Meshera would spread across all of
      Ylva, leaving it a place unsuitable for life.'
  - actor: '3'
    text: So now we understand the truth of the Forest. And yet, now another question
      is even more difficult to grasp. What the hell is the meaning behind doing this?
      I could understand if the motive was revenge against those who had abused the
      Elea, but what point would such an action have if all life perishes as a result?
  - actor: '5'
    text: It is not revenge. It is both a punishment and a chance. Besides, life will
      not perish. Salvation is already within our grasp.
  - actor: '5'
    text: I believe Rehm-Ido to be the ideal civilization. Yet, something as weak
      as fellowship isn't enough to keep the Yutasu in check. In order to overcome
      the Yutasu, the civilization must have a stronger and more precise will. When
      the time comes, you will understand. For this plan to succeed, the sacrifice
      of Vindale was required.
