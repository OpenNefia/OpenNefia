    Meanwhile, in the throne room of Palmia.

  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: It's wonderful to see you again, Larnneire. You have grown from a naughty
      little child into a splendid woman since last we met. I'm sure your journey
      here must have been harsh, given the circumstances.
  - actor: '2'
    text: It's been a long time, Your Majesty. Thanks to your influence, we were able
      to arrive here without incident. At this time, as a messenger from the Forest,
      and for the sake of both the Elea and all of Sierra Terre, I would like to request
      that Palmia lend the Elea its strength in dealing with the Heretical Forest.
  - actor: '1'
    text: '...Larnneire, I am truly sorry, but I''m afraid that I cannot lend you
      that aid that you seek. I too am pained by the tragedy befalling the Elea, but
      as I''m sure you''re aware, the most Palmia can do is seek to keep a balance
      between the Yerles and the Eulderna.'
  - actor: '1'
    text: The Prince of Zanan has already gathered significant support from various
      nations and their peoples, and they have found a common enemy in the Heretical
      Forest. If Palmia were to speak against this now, not only would Zanan treat
      us as rebels, but the two great nations would as well. If Palmia were to fall,
      there would no longer be any barrier against a war between the two great nations.
      I simply cannot condemn Sierra Terre to another great war.
  - actor: '2'
    text: '...Is your intent then for the Elea to be the sacrificial lambs on the
      altar of peace between the two great nations? Our country was only established
      because the blood of innocent Elea was being shed in foreign nations. What peace
      we have had has been short and fragile. Is there no longer anyone on this continent
      with the heart to reach out to the weak?'
  - actor: '3'
    text: '...If they committed no sin, then their fate is truly regrettable. Yet,
      surely you''re aware of what your Heretical Forest and its Ether Winds have
      wrought upon the world?'
  - actor: '2'
    text: So you've come, Lord Barius? Certainly it is undeniable that strange events
      have been occurring in the Forest due to the Ether Winds. But for what reason
      would the Vindale Forest, which has posed no problems for all of Sierra Terre,
      suddenly act up now? Is it not prejudice to lay blame at the feet of the Elea
      without first investigating?
  - actor: '2'
    text: Your Majesty, please heed my words. The issue of the Ether Winds and the
      Forest is not related to the calamity that they speak of. If the claims that
      the Prince of Zanan makes are wrong...
  - actor: '1'
    text: Speak no further, Larnneire.
  - actor: '2'
    text: But Your Majesty, the truth...
  - actor: '1'
    text: I said that's enough. I'll hear the rest of what you have to say tomorrow.
      I will have arrangements made for you and your companion to stay tonight at
      the inn. Now is... not the time for us to continue. Please understand.

    text: Your Majesty... Very well. But I will be back again tomorrow. You are the
      Elea's final hope.

  dialog:
  - actor: '4'
    text: How embarrassing. Don't believe the girl's lies, King Xabi.
  - actor: '4'
    text: I began investigating this disaster at a young age. The "Meshera" are also
      known as the "World Devouring Giants". Is the Heretical Forest, whose roots
      spread and eat away our lands, not exactly that? Even were her claims that the
      Forest and the Meshera are unrelated to be true, it is undeniable that the Forest
      is consuming our land and producing terrible monsters. King Xabi, I must insist
      that you entrust that girl to my care.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Hmm. Could that be because what Larnneire speaks is the truth?
  - actor: '4'
    text: What I have told you is the truth. I have my own interests in that girl.
      More importantly, King Xabi, have you forgotten that Palmia's existence is reliant
      upon Zanan?
  - actor: '1'
    text: Larnneire is an important guest. Even if the request is coming from the
      Prince of Zanan himself, I cannot hand her over. Palmia will forsake all involvement
      with the issue of the Vindale Forest. Is that not enough to satisfy you? You
      must excuse me for now. I have other business that must be attended to.

    text: '...Fufu, she escaped. Still, I was surprised. Is she not the spitting image
      of her?'
  - actor: '3'
    text: First the White Hawk, and now her. At last the wheels of destiny have begun
      to turn.
  - actor: '4'
    text: While I don't believe in fate, this lively stage that has been set has exceeded
      my expectations. I welcome it. We must prepare a suitable role for them. I have
      faith in your abilities, Barius The Blue Haired.
