    Meanwhile, in Saimore's camp.

  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: I'm sure you've heard about the funeral of the late Prince Clyne, yes? Twas
      a grand affair, after all. Yet, few people are aware that there was no corpse
      within his coffin. The world was told that Clyne's death was a result of falling
      off a cliff while out on a ride... But that's not the truth. Would you care
      to take a guess at what is? Clyne was murdered. Murdered by that albino boy
      that everyone despised.
  - actor: '1'
    text: As Clyne took in the view from the mountainside, his brother pushed him
      off the cliff. And when he made that push, something within him died as well.
      Having struggled his entire life to not be a burden on others, it was the first
      time the boy felt powerful and free. And yet in that moment, in his lust to
      deny and overturn the values of his brother whom the world viewed as a success,
      he abandoned himself. His pacifism, his compassion for the poor, his affection
      for the weak, all of the morals he touted - he betrayed them all and became
      nothing more than a tool for the power he had despised all his life.
  - actor: '1'
    text: And even after becoming the successor to Zanan, he was unable to move forward.
      Oh, he could exercise his power and become a second Clyne if he so wished. But
      could he truly deny everything he once was? His past self that was so ugly and
      weak? Could he honestly turn his head, pretending that the pain and conflict
      that he and others had experienced each and every day did not exist? It was
      the very means by which I affirmed myself that also took away my ability to
      accept the world. Morals, values, emotions... What had I left to believe in?
      But don't misunderstand. I am not attempting to garner your sympathy by making
      it appear that I am unhappy or feel regret.
  - actor: '3'
    text: Why tell me your story, then? To be honest, the choices you have defined
      for yourself appear as simple deception to me. Could that boy from the past
      who preached compassion towards the weak truly accept becoming such an ugly
      person as you are now? I won't say that I don't understand your pain. But having
      been rejected by the world - No, I should say having turned your back on it
      - and running from a life you felt incomplete, wishing nothing but pain and
      hatred upon yourself... I can't help but wonder if you're using these things
      to fill the emptiness in your heart.
  - actor: '3'
    text: You say you had nothing left to believe in, but I feel that potential still
      lies within your heart. I think you have decided that some things are undeserving
      of love, and that you yourself are one of them. But I think that relationships
      can be built with methods others than hatred and insincerity.
  - actor: '1'
    text: '...How surprising. It is once again a young Elean girl that offers me the
      light known as hope as I drown within the darkness of my despair. But I''m afraid
      that the time where that may have been useful has passed. If nothing else, I
      now understand that if such a thing as good will existed within this world that
      there may have yet been another path for me. For that, at least, I am grateful.'
  - actor: '1'
    text: '...Ah yes, I promised to tell you the secret of the Forest, didn''t I?
      As you thought, the Ether Wind and the Forest''s expansion are not the calamity
      known as the "Meshera". Meshera is... a bacteria, so to speak, that devours
      all life. It all but perished once during the era of Rehm-Ido, but has risen
      again with the advent of Sierra Terre. Or perhaps I should say that Sierra Terre
      is Meshera itself. The World-Devouring Giants live within me, within you, within
      all living creatures.'
  - actor: '3'
    text: But... If that's the case, if we're all infected by the Meshera, how are
      we alive?
  - actor: '1'
    text: I can't spoil the fun by giving everything away, now can I? I'll answer
      your question as strictly as I can. The reason that we can exist is due to the
      Heretical Forest. Were the Forest to be destroyed, all life on Ylva would disappear,
      though whether it would take a single year or a hundred I cannot say. Fufu.
      "Heretical Forest" is such an ironic name. It is we who are the true heretics
      of this world.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Now it's only a matter of time before the Vindale Forest is destroyed by
      human hands. When everything that the people of the world believe in collapses,
      when they learn the truth too late to reverse their actions, what do you think
      will become of the world? I, for one, am looking forward to finding out.
  - actor: '3'
    text: This is absurd. While I could sympathize with your background, how could
      you escalate a personal issue to one of life and death for the entire world?
  - actor: '1'
    text: Ah, but is it not that absurdity that makes it enjoyable? If you would prefer
      to discuss philosophy, speak with Barius instead. His own motivations differ
      from my own... But this conversation is at an end. Rest well, Witch of the Heretical
      Forest. I have an amusing scenario planned for you tomorrow.
