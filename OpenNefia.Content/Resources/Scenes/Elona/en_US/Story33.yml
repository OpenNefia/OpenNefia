    text: So this is the institution that Saimore was talking about. Looks like it's
      been abandoned though. There doesn't appear to be anyone here, and the equipment
      doesn't seem to have been used recently either. I hope the information we came
      for is still here.
  - actor: '5'
    text: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the "evidence" you're looking for
      isn't here.
  - actor: '2'
    text: You...
  - actor: '5'
    text: Not that it matters. Even if you found the evidence you're looking for,
      who would listen to an Elea anymore? Oh, but don't worry. I haven't come to
      interfere with you. I came to tell you the truth about the Vindale Forest.
  - actor: '3'
    text: And we should believe the words of someone who would betray his race, and
      our captor no less?
  - actor: '5'
    text: It's your choice whether or not to believe me. But there's no use in wasting
      your precious time on a plan that will bear no fruits. As someone with the blood
      of the Elea, I can sympathize with you.

  dialog:

    text: How much do you know about the civilization of Rehm-Ido? Rehm-Ido overcame
      the materialism that had plagued Eyth Terre, and even after 300 years was considered
      to be the greatest civilization of the world. All across the nation various
      communities were joined by the idea of mutual cooperation with each other and
      harmony with nature.
  - actor: '5'
    text: Yet among these communities was a group that differed from the others, known
      as the Yutasu. Rather than being a close-knit community, "Yutasu" was simply
      a generic term for those who lacked the ability to fit in with the other communities.
      Those who couldn't form close bonds with others, those with abnormal desires,
      those who preferred solitude, those without morals, materialists... Anyone who
      didn't fit in with the other communities was named Yutasu, and while it wasn't
      visible on the surface, they were detested by society.
  - actor: '5'
    text: The substance that we know as Ether was discovered by accident near the
      end of Rehm-Ido. Rehm-Ido had highly advanced biochemistry, and Ether proved
      to be a valuable resource that provided a chemical change to a variety of medicines.
      And perhaps most importantly, Ether could be harvested from trees and was environment
      friendly, a perfect fit for the ideology of Rehm-Ido.
  - actor: '5'
    text: With the discovery of Ether came a great change in the position of Yutasu
      in society. The process of Ether collection was called "Star Harvesting" and
      considered sacred... And the Yutasu were the greatest land holders. Through
      the process of "Star Harvesting", the Yutasu regained their injured self-esteem
      and found their place in the society of Rehm-Ido. It was for this reason that,
      despite knowing it was coming, they averted their eyes from the creeping threat
      of the Meshera...
  - actor: '5'
    text: How the Meshera came to be remains a mystery. What is known is that it was
      Ether that was responsible for the immune system of the forests. With the rampant
      collection of Ether, the forests were left easy prey for the Meshera. Because
      the Yutasu were afraid of losing their status they had gained as Ether collectors,
      by the time the rest of the world noticed what was happening, it was too late
      to do anything.
  - actor: '5'
    text: The forest "devouring" Meshera gradually spread, and where they spread,
      they created an environment where no other life on Ylva could survive. The civilization
      of Rehm-Ido was slowly slipping towards its death.
