  dialog:
  - actor: '3'
    text: '...Look! There are flames in the Forest. Has Zanan already begun the invasion?'
  - actor: '2'
    text: Hurry, Lomias! Head to the Forest! Those who were slow to get out or who
      stayed need to be evacuated.
  - actor: '3'
    text: Got it. And you, Larnneire?
  - actor: '2'
    text: I will go to Saimore. It may gain us nothing to negotiate at this point,
      but even so, for the sake of the Elea who are evacuating... If nothing else,
      I'll earn them time.
  - actor: '1'
    text: We will go with Larnneire. While the Forest still lives, we humans cannot
      enter.
  - actor: '4'
    text: Don't worry, Larnneire. I won't allow any soldiers to lay a single finger
      on you before we reach Saimore.
