    Meanwhile, at the bar in Palmia.

  dialog:
  - actor: '2'
    text: We're looking for a woman named Liana. Do you know of her?
  - actor: '3'
    text: '...And what business do you have with her?'
  - actor: '2'
    text: We've been told that she'll fulfill any request, so long as the price is
      right. While I don't feel as if we need one, we were instructed to seek out
      Liana by the King so that we may hire a guard.
  - actor: '3'
    text: Any request for a price, is it? ...Fufu. Well, I certainly know someone
      who is skilled enough to help you, regardless of what danger it is you find
      yourself in. But for that man, it comes down to whether he feels like it or
      not, not a price. Yes, I am Liana. Both of you, come with me.

  - actor: '3'
    text: You barely eat, and yet here you are inhaling crimberry smoke. My precious
      Bethel... Come now, stand up. You need to greet the clients.
  - actor: '2'
    text: Oh, wonderful. The sword master we're supposed to rely on for protection
      is a drug addled mess. Larnneire, this is pointless. Regardless of what skill
      this man may have had, we don't have time for him to sober up.
  - actor: '3'
    text: Now now... there's no need to be in such a rush. Don't mind them, Bethel.
      These people don't know the terrible things that you've been through. When I
      first saw your haunted eyes, I knew. This man has known unimaginable suffering.
      He's a pitiful man that can't let go of his past. But as long as he sticks with
      me, I'm sure I'll be able to help him overcome that. But you know, Bethel...
      If you don't work, you can't eat!

    text: Fufu. Liana, I don't plan on taking you with me to the next world. Now,
      the request...
  - actor: '4'
    text: '...Elishe...?'
  - actor: '1'
    text: Elishe?
  - actor: '4'
    text: No, never mind. Tell me about your request.
  - actor: '2'
    text: There'll be no need for that. Let us just consider the order to hire a drug
      addled bodyguard a poor Palmian joke. I don't recall there being anyone out
      to get us anyway.
  - actor: '4'
    text: '...The drugs may have dulled my senses, but I''m still easily capable of
      guarding you. And given the number of presences I can sense surrounding the
      place, I think you''ll find you need someone of my caliber.'
  - actor: '1'
    text: This place is surrounded? Are they aiming for us?
  - actor: '4'
    text: We don't have time to stop and ask questions. Don't lose sight of me. We're
      going to leave the city through the alleyways.
