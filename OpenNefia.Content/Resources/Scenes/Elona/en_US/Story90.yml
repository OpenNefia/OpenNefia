  - actor: '5'
    text: My my, to what do I owe the pleasure of receiving a Witch of the Heretical
      Forest here?
  - actor: '2'
    text: Barius, why are you... Where is Saimore? Let me talk to him.
  - actor: '5'
    text: He is no longer here, nor do I know where he has gone. I have taken command.
      And unfortunately for you, I have no intention of negotiating.
  - actor: '2'
    text: I know it's too late to stop the flames. But please, stop attacking the
      Elea who are escaping the Forest. They don't even have weapons with which to
      resist.
  - actor: '5'
    text: I said I would not negotiate. But I am different than him. If no one stands
      in the way of our goal, then there is no need for bloodshed.

  dialog:
  - actor: '3'
    text: Lord Barius, a distress signal has gone up from the Forest. I'm afraid a
      group got lost in the smoke, and after coming in contact with the Forest's miasma,
      is unable to escape.
  - actor: '5'
    text: Inside the Forest? Fools... Leave them. The Forest is still alive. And don't
      bother me with every little message.
  - actor: '2'
    text: '...Tell me where the signal came from. I will help.'
  - actor: '5'
    text: Fufu, amusing. You intend to save those who burn your home and slaughter
      your kin?
  - actor: '4'
    text: This is unnecessary. Don't you hate them for what they're doing?
  - actor: '2'
    text: Let go of my arm, Bethel. It's precisely because of this situation that
      I must go. I must show that even for those who can't understand each other,
      you can't abandon the idea that possibilities exist beyond a simple wall of
      hatred and distrust.
  - actor: '4'
    text: I am begging you... Please, Larnneire, don't go. If you enter the Forest,
      I won't be able to follow you. I won't be able to protect you. Will you once
      again carve the pain of that day into my heart?
  - actor: '2'
    text: If I abandon them here then I have betrayed myself, as well as the Elishe
      that you loved. I know that it cannot be only sorrow that she brought you. Goodbye,
      White Hawk of Altiheit. No matter how many tears you shed from the pain of the
      wounds upon your wings, I pray that the day will come that you will be able
      to fly once more.
