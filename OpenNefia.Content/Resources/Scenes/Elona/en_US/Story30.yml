  - actor: '1'
    text: On that day... It was a cool Autumn night. I had gone to see a play together
      with Elishe. It was mediocre in every sense, but I can still remember it even
      now. There's nothing about that day I can forget.
  - actor: '1'
    text: As we made our way home from the play, smoke and screams arose from a nearby
      mansion. We rushed over as quickly as we could, and when we arrived, the flames
      were still low. We immediately set about rescuing people. Elishe refused to
      stop until she could be certain nobody was left inside, until no more voices
      were crying out. And... A part of the exit-way suddenly collapsed on her...
  - actor: '1'
    text: I immediately rushed to her and attempted to lift the beam off of her, but
      it was impossible for me to do by myself. I turned to seek help from those around
      us, but my pleas were met only by the scared and cruel gazes of the onlookers.
      They were going to leave the young Elean girl who had been their savior to die.
      But what right had I to fault them? If a rival had needed my help, my reaction
      would have been the same as theirs... Before long, the flames had engulfed everything.
  - actor: '1'
    text: I buried my head into the ground until dawn came. When I came across Elishe's
      bones when searching that charred rubble, I cried for the first time... And
      time has been frozen for me ever since.
...
