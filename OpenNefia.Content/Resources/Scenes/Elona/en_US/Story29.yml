    text: Before I left for Altiheit, I was enrolled in a military academy called
      Ateran, a place for those who are exceptionally gifted to sharpen their talents
      even further. For the kind of people at Ateran, power is everything. To them,
      everyone else is an enemy, nothing more than tools to be used in order to get
      ahead. They show no hesitation in using the weak as stepping stones... And I
      was no different. Knowingly or not, whether they resisted or not, I harmed many
      people. I was an arrogant and ruthless man.

    text: One day I came down with a terrible illness and had to leave Ateran. Through
      the attentive care of my younger brother, my only remaining relative, I narrowly
      survived. But when I rejoined the world after two months of recovery, it seemed
      like an entirely different place.

    text: Suddenly, when others looked at me, it was if I could feel their malice
      and contempt. Even in the eyes of children, a person like me who had left Ateran
      was nothing but a piece of trash... Of course, they didn't actually feel that
      way. I was terrorizing myself by projecting my own way of thinking onto others.
      It wasn't until that moment that I realized just how ugly and totally devoid
      of humanity I was.

    text: '...I tried to change myself. But regardless of any efforts I made to find
      inner pieace, even when I otherwise kept myself engaged, the part of me that
      had been trained in Ateran sneered at how pathetic I was, tempting me to return.
      Even now I doubt I''ve fully separated myself from the values that place instilled
      in me. I fought that side of myself for many years, and in the end, I had nothing
      but a feeling of emptiness and a desire to erase everything about myself. That''s
      why I left home.'

    text: Elishe was different from any person I had ever met. She was not a beautiful
      woman as you are, but her eyes... They saw everything as it truly was, and forgave
      it. Accepted it... You have those eyes as well. The years I spent together with
      her in Altiheit will forever occupy a large place in my heart. Elishe was my
      reason to live, in every sense of the phrase.
  - actor: '1'
    text: In order to protect her, in order to make her happy, I was able to accept
      my past self. By telling myself it was for her, I was capable of using others
      as tools and doing terrible things to guarantee success. My internal struggle
      had been entrusted to Elishe. And, after more than seven years in Altiheit,
      I had become a top officer in Zanan...
