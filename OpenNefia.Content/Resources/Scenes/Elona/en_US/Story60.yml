  dialog:
  - actor: '5'
    text: The border of Karune is in sight. If we keep a steady pace, we'll reach
      Vindale in three days.
  - actor: '4'
    text: What do you intend to do after returning to the Forest? With our strength,
      even delaying the invasion by Zanan would be difficult, let alone stopping them.
  - actor: '5'
    text: We will warn the people of the Forest. They may not have even realized the
      threat creeping towards them. After that, I don't know. Having our home destroyed
      is painful, yet part of me believes they should do as they damn well please.
      Those who took part in the Forest's destruction and those who stood on the sidelines
      and allowed it will realize with despair what they have wrought. But Larnneire...
      What do you think?
  - actor: '3'
    text: I can understand how you feel. But I want to stay true to myself until the
      end. I want to do everything I can to protect the Forest. Even if we fail, perhaps
      we'll leave a bud of hope that will live afterwards.

  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: How does it feel to destroy your home, Barius? The Eulderna are in Karune
      and can move at any time. They only wait for orders.
  - actor: '2'
    text: '...Our miscalculations led to the Yerles not participating. Much of the
      meaning of this war was to have the whole world involved. But, there won''t
      be any interference with the invasion. Vindale isn''t prepared for war.'
  - actor: '1'
    text: Once the Forest is gone, I leave things in your hands. I intend to hide,
      though with this body I'm sure I won't stay hidden long. But that's fine. As
      long as I can leave a scar on Ylva, I will be satisfied.
