    - At the bar in Vernis -

  - actor: '1'
    text: What's going on here?
  - actor: '2'
    text: Oh, captain. Ain't nothing serious. Just questioning this suspicious looking
      man here. With the Prince in the area, a guard can't just overlook suspicious
      people even while at the bar! ...Hey, you. Are you listening?
  - actor: '3'
    text: '...'
  - actor: '1'
    text: This man is...
  - actor: '2'
    text: Yeah, as you can see, he's not much for manners. I'll just rough him up
      a bit more and then send him away. I couldn't possibly enjoy my drink now if
      I don't cause him at least some pain.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Stop.
  - actor: '2'
    text: C'mon Captain. If I break one of his legs, it'll just give the beggar an
      easier time.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Whose benefit do you think I said that for? This man is the White Hawk of
      Zanan. Leave us alone for a while.

    text: You've changed. The White Hawk of Zanan, given the privileges of an aristocrat,
      whose talent was envied and whose deeds were praised by all, now sits in the
      corner of a rundown bar, gazing at the world with the eyes of a dead man. It
      was troubling, you know, to no longer have anyone to compete with once you left
      Zanan.

    text: Heh, not even a single response to all of that. When you're bored of this
      little act, do you ever think back to what you told me back then?
  - actor: '1'
    text: You've been stripped of your fame and wealth and look like nothing more
      than a common beggar. What an unimaginable joke you are now compared to what
      you once were. Did you decide, perhaps, to cast off your desires and live the
      life of a sinner as a memorial to that girl?
  - actor: '3'
    text: I don't want to hear it.
  - actor: '1'
    text: That Elean lass... Elishe, was it? If you'll allow me to borrow your own
      words here, wasn't even she just a part of your mask?
  - actor: '3'
    text: I have no intention of playing twenty questions with you. I'd rather be
      beaten and thrown into prison than answer your questions.
  - actor: '1'
    text: As you request then, Bethel Rumford. It seems you've become soft. Any danger
      you may have posed has long since left you.
