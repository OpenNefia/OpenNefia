    A soldier bearing the crest of Zanan hails you as you enter the town of Vernis.

    After a round of careful questioning, the Zanan soldier that had regarded you
    with suspicion informs you that the Crown Prince of Zanan is in the town on
    campaign.

    You notice that a crowd is gathered in the village square, listening intently to
    the albino prince that leans weakly against his attendant.

  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: '...And so I am overcome with grief. Zanan has lost the war with the new
      Kingdoms, and without its leader, shall become host to the conflict between
      the two great nations for many years to come. Even if the late Prince Clyne
      were still alive and was to make a bid for peace, the war between these nations
      would not be silenced.'
  - actor: '1'
    text: War... Can not these nations who wish to stain themselves with blood and
      flame recognize that an unimaginable crisis has befallen Sierra Terre? These
      evil winds spoil our forests, take the lives of our countrymen, and rob us of
      our lands. The Elea and their Heretical Forest plan to revive the Meshera, the
      nightmares that destroyed the civilization of Rehm-Ido.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Now is the time for unity - A great trial has been thrust upon Ylva, and
      if we put aside our petty squabbles and learn to understand one another, we
      can destroy the Heretics and their Forest. Together we can overcome this catastrophe.
  - actor: '1'
    text: 'Zanan is no longer the superpower that it once was. But hear me, my friends:
      we are not powerless. Palmia, which has heretofore withstood the power of the
      two great nations and has the faith and determination of its people, is the
      hope of Sierra Terre.'

    A great cheer rose from the square.

    The speaker's voice was drowned out by the sound, no longer reaching your
    ears where you stood at the back of the crowd.

    You leave the square slowly, remembering the albino prince with a strange sense
    of both unease and interest.
...
