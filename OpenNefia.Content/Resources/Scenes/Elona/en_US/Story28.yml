    text: Bethel... I'm just thinking. About the Forest, about the Ether Wind, about
      what Saimore is expecting, about our journey... I can't say I've found any answers
      though.

    text: Like you, she was an Elea from Vindale. While we weren't blood related,
      we loved and supported one another like family while we lived in the port city
      of Altiheit in Zanan... I should stop. I'm sure this is boring for you.
  - actor: '2'
    text: No, please continue. I'd like to hear about it.

    text: '...At the time, the war between the Yerles and the Eulderna was in full
      force, and many people got caught in the middle. I was still young, and the
      war had left me with nothing but disappointment and a feeling of emptiness.
      All I cared about was getting away from my home town, so I slipped aboard a
      ship carrying war orphans to Altiheit. It was there, in Altiheit, that I met
      Elishe.'
  - actor: '1'
    text: They looked at her with nothing but contempt, and their words towards her
      were nothing but abuse. They blamed her for an illness that had been spreading
      throughout the ship, and consequently, no orphanage would take her in. But Elishe
      stood strong and endured their abuse and contempt, as if that kind of treatment
      was normal for her. Before I even realized what I was doing, I was standing
      in front of her and holding her hand.

    text: Scrounging up enough to eat isn't easy for two children living alone in
      an unfamiliar city. But we took shelter in one of the port warehouses, and by
      working, managed to stave off hunger. While I worked for her sake, I found that
      my disappointment slowly began to fade. And then... Something strange happened.
  - actor: '1'
    text: A leather bag began to be placed in the window of the warehouse every morning
      on the day of worship. Inside was hard bread and good cheese, a few gold coins,
      and occasionally even medicine or clothing. Someone was lending us a helping
      hand from the shadows. I once asked the man who brought the bag about it, but
      he dodged my question by saying it was from "The Fairy of Altiheit".
  - actor: '1'
    text: Whether that man was the "fairy" himself or simply a courier, I never found
      out. But I'm sure whoever it was noticed that it wasn't just bread or coin that
      bag brought us, but hope. Elishe and I clung to that faint light of hope and
      used it to weather our difficulties in Altiheit...
