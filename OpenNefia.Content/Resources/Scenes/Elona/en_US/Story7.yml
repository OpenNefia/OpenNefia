    Meanwhile, at the palace in Derphy.

  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: You're King Xabi's young female guest?
  - actor: '2'
    text: '...Yes. My name is Larnneire.'
  - actor: '3'
    text: The cold-hearted shadow of Deprhy, Duke Sevilis. I recall the King once
      mentioning to rely on you in case of an emergency, and so we have come. Someone
      is after us, though we are unaware of their identity. Could you use your connections
      in the underworld to find out?
  - actor: '1'
    text: I see. You did well to rely on me. The ones pursuing you are from Zanan...
      Saimore, to be precise. Heh, there's no need to have anyone investigate that.
      Let's see, so we have both the girl and the White Hawk here. You've changed
      quite a bit since last I saw you, Bethel Rumford. Why is it you yet live with
      such regret?
  - actor: '4'
    text: I wasn't aware one needed a reason to continue living. And forgive me for
      my rudeness, Duke Sevilis, but I don't recall us having met before.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Heh, I'm not surprised. You'd be unlikely to remember me with this face.
      We've both changed. Now, regarding your group's fate...

  dialog:
  - actor: '5'
    text: Lord Sevilis, Sir Barius urges you to hurry.
  - actor: '3'
    text: '...Barius?'
  - actor: '1'
    text: My apologies. As you've no doubt surmised, I was visited by another guest
      before your arrival. While I'm sure you're tired from your long trip from Palmia,
      Larnneire, I'll have to ask that you accompany him. Though, it's not really
      a choice. The palace is already surrounded.
  - actor: '2'
    text: So you will hand me over to Zanan. Would you betray the trust of King Xabi
      so easily?
  - actor: '1'
    text: '...Relax. Saimore will harm neither you nor your companions.'
  - actor: '4'
    text: You will regret this, Duke Sevilis. I will remember your betrayal, and I
      am a vindictive man.

  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: This is enough, isn't it?
  - actor: '6'
    text: Yes. I appreciate your cooperation.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Your methods are as dirty as ever, Barius. Do you intend to keep your promise?
  - actor: '6'
    text: Don't worry. Your subordinates have been treated courteously. I'll have
      them delivered at dawn... Oh yes, and I won't mention to Saimore that you're
      still alive. It would be quite the inconvenience if he were to find out, wouldn't
      it?
  - actor: '1'
    text: '...Do as you like.'
