    -Epilogue-

    <At the end of every adventure lies a new journey.>
  - |
    The Vindale Forest was lost.

    Though the people who heard the
    news praised the Prince of Zanan,
    the world gradually began to change.
  - |
    Unknown illnesses began to spread,
    crops withered, and dry winds raged.

    By the time people began to notice these
    strange occurrences, Barius of Zanan had a
    female Elea, a survivor of the war, standing
    witness before the Imperial Court.
  - |
    The woman told the world the truth.

    The Vindale Forest, which people had
    referred to as the Heretical Forest, had
    been suppressing the power of the Meshera.

    And with the destruction of the
    Forest, Ylva would soon change to
    become uninhabitable by all peoples.
  - |
    The people of Ylva were taken aback by this testimony.

    Some were heartbroken, others
    filled with regret, and as always,
    others cared not at all.

    Dark times had come to Sierra Terre.
  - |
    But not all hope was lost.

    It was as Barius said. Another Heretical Forest
    was left in Ylva. Strangely, it was something
    that Saimore had created for research when
    still the Second Prince of Zanan.
  - |
    The country of Zanan which had led the attack on Vindale split,
    and the community of Rosuria, ruled by Barius, was born.

    Rosuria would cultivate the Forest, promote
    peace, and without regard for borders allow
    people to visit the Forest and be cured of
    their disease.
  - |
    The promised land of Rosuria was expected
    to become the utopia of Ylva.
  - |
    -Three Years Later-
  - |
    You have wandered from country to country, and
    like the first time you visited North Tyris, have
    slipped upon a merchant ship headed for Port Kapul.
  - |
    Three years have brought many changes.

    The scars left on Ylva are deep. Although
    the sadness may never be overcome, over
    time, the towns regained their bustle
    and the people have forgotten the nightmare,
    or at least behave as if they have.
  - |
    Rosuria has become corrupted.

    With the salvation they offered, Rosura attracted
    great wealth as well as the interest of many countries
    like the Yerles, and Rosuria was left at their mercy.

    Even with the world headed towards destruction,
    Ylva could not be united under Rosuria. With
    each country plotting and planning, new dark
    clouds of dispute have begun to cover Ylva.
  - |
    And now, your journey into the shadow of
    confusion covering Ylva is about to begin.
  - |
    You spent a great deal of time deciphering the
    writing of truth discovered in Lesimas, and
    discovered that between the era of Rehm-Ido
    and the previous civilization an unknown era
    known as Naku Domara existed.

    It was in this time that Chaos and magic were brought
    to Ylva, as well as the time that holds the keys to
    the mysterious civilization of Nefia.
  - |
    As you land in Port Kapul, the nostalgic cool
    winds of North Tyris brush against your face.
    You take a step forward.
  - |
    In your future, a wondrous yet difficult
    adventure concerning the Eternal League
    of Nefia awaits.
  - |
    Eternal League of Nefia
