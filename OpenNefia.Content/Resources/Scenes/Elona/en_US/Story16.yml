    Meanwhile, in the bar in Derphy.

  dialog:
  - actor: '3'
    text: Hoh, so you came without your subordinates. Don't expect me to forget that
      you're our "lifeline" with Zanan though.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Zanan itself has nothing to do with all of this. The girl's confinement
      is a direct order from Saimore. From what I understand though, he's ready to
      release her at any time.
  - actor: '4'
    text: And what does Saimore want in return?
  - actor: '1'
    text: Very soon the leaders from various countries will be gathering in Palmia
      for discussion. His request is that she attend as a representative of the Elea.
  - actor: '3'
    text: '...That''s it? That kind of opportunity is something we''ve been desperately
      hoping for. What would he stand to gain from this?'
  - actor: '1'
    text: If his intent was simply to arrest you all, there were innumerable methods
      he could have chosen. I'm sure Saimore has some twisted event planned... something
      he'll find humorous.
