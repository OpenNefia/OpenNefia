  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: No need to be so tense, Elea. I have no intention of harming you. I simply
      wish for a conversational partner. Someone to talk to about myself.
  - actor: '3'
    text: Someone to talk to? Don't expect for us to reach some sort of understanding.
      You're slyly manipulating the public opinion in order to call for the destruction
      of the Vindale Forest. Until you can provide some evidence that the issue of
      the Forest and the Ether Winds are the cause of the calamity of which you speak,
      the Elea will never believe you.
  - actor: '1'
    text: There's no need for you to believe me. In fact, my story is a lie. Rather
      than being the cause of the calamity, the Vindale Forest is an antidote of sorts.
      It senses the revival of the Meshera and is releasing an antibody which we know
      as Ether.

    text: Fufu, got your attention now do I? But I'm afraid you'll have to listen
      to my tale before I inform you of the truth of the Forest.

  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: This story is from long ago. There were once two princes in Zanan. One was
      a frail and ugly albino, while the other was his handsome and vigorous brother
      Clyne. The name of the first, I think, need not be mentioned. The two princes
      were as different as light and shadow. The warlike Clyne was naturally successful,
      while his brother who lived in his shadow was a failure.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Unlike his brother, the younger boy despised conflict, instead preferring
      song and poem. He was a pacifist and did much to help the disadvantaged and
      those that were orphaned by the war. Among these, he took a particular interest
      in the "Heretical" Elea and their Forest. While Clyne amused himself with hunting
      and socializing, the younger boy devoted himself to studying the Forest. Hope,
      after all, is something born of ignorance. Perhaps it was that he saw something
      of himself in the Heretical Forest. By eliminating the prejudice and suspicion
      regarding the Forest, and by exploring a path of coexistence with the Elea,
      he believed the world might change...
  - actor: '1'
    text: And yet years passed while his research made little progress. Fufu, the
      boy simply could not come to terms with the life of an adult. He couldn't accept
      that the world was at its core an unkind and unfair place where the strong rule
      over the weak. He began to begrudge his brother who continuously rose in power,
      all the while cursing himself for being born an albino and hating the world
      that refused to change its ways... And then, he met an angel.
  - actor: '1'
    text: She was an Elean girl roughly his own age. From the moment he saw her he
      was fascinated with her. Her chestnut eyes were strong, gentle, and overflowing
      with compassion. As he watched her live a strong life in Zanan which is notoriously
      cruel to her kind, he once again saw a part of himself in the Elea.
  - actor: '1'
    text: For the boy, she was... No, I think that's a story for another time... Suffice
      it to say that her passing left nothing but a gaping wound upon the boy's heart.
      Even now I am pained by my memories of that time... Let's continue this later.
      There is more than enough time to discuss everything.
