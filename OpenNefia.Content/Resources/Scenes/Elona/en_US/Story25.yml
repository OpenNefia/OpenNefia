    Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Vernis.

  dialog:
  - actor: '3'
    text: It's no use. We can't enter Vernis. The city is already abuzz with rumors
      about a Witch from the Heretical Forest using wicked magic to murder the king
      of Palmia for refusing to support Vindale.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Saimore's aim is clear. By making us public enemies, he will drive us to
      the Heretical Forest and use that as an excuse for war.
  - actor: '3'
    text: War, is it? The Elean people have neither the weapons nor stupidity required
      for such a thing. But if even avoiding conflict and secluding ourselves within
      the Forest leads to such distrust, what else is left to us?
  - actor: '2'
    text: Even if that's what Saimore plans, we still must go to the Forest to warn
      everyone. But I think we should make another stop first. Saimore told me to
      seek his research institute if I wanted to know more about the secrets of the
      Forest.
  - actor: '3'
    text: And you intend to just do what he says?
  - actor: '2'
    text: He claimed that the Vindale Forest is keeping the Meshera in check. Obtaining
      evidence of that might just be the only hope we have left. And... I don't know
      quite how to say it, but I feel like he's waiting. He's waiting to see what
      path we will choose.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Then we head for Zanan. Been a long time hasn't it, Bethel?
  - actor: '4'
    text: '...'
