  dialog:
  - actor: '4'
    text: Sevilis, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. How is it that
      you know me?
  - actor: '1'
    text: '...I once wore the name of Clyne. Is that name familiar to you? The heir
      of Zanan, and the man Saimore killed.'
  - actor: '4'
    text: Then you are the true King of Zanan? ...Interesting. But that doesn't answer
      my question.
  - actor: '1'
    text: A single girl was the trigger of everything. A light rain was falling in
      Altiheit, scattering the streetlight as it fell to the earth. A group of people
      surrounded and gazed cruelly at a young Elean girl, and a beautiful blonde young
      man protected her without hesitation. From that moment, he was like her brother...
      That event became Saimore's hope, and the White Hawk became the target of his
      admiration.

    text: Elishe...
  - actor: '1'
    text: Saimore wished for the two of you to live a happy life... And so he helped.
      You should know well that, even in a merit-based society like Zanan, without
      some sort of connection it's difficult to realize the dream of become an Officer
      of the Imperial Court while associating with an Elean girl.

    text: '...The Fairy of Altiheit... was Saimore...'
