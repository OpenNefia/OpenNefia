    Meanwhile, on a boat headed towards Zanan.

  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: I can't seem to fall asleep. Just what is it you're looking for out there?
  - actor: '2'
    text: Oh, Sevilis... I'm just thinking about the people Lomias and I left at the
      Forest. We left shouldering everyone's expectations. I was looking forward to
      seeing their smiling faces when we returned, but... This journey has become
      so long and painful. I'm truly sorry we got you involved in this. And I'm grateful
      you prepared this ship for us.
  - actor: '1'
    text: There's no need to thank me. I have my own grudge against Zanan. I'm here
      of my own free will... And Bethel, too, has his own reasons for coming.
  - actor: '2'
    text: You seem to know him... Bethel is a good man, I think. He seemed difficult
      to approach at first, but he has risked his life to protect us, and given us
      encouragement through our hardships. Even Lomias of all people has changed how
      he feels about him. But that smile he wears seems sad for some reason. It makes
      it seem... Like he's given up. Sometimes it feels like he's wearing a mask to
      hide his heart from other people.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Some people don't mesh well with this world. Yes, he has his own problems,
      and he knows better than anyone else that he's the only one who can deal with
      them. But he can't bring himself to seek the sympathy and consolation of others.
      Some people will cling to and fight for and glimmer of hope that shows itself,
      while others will surrender and wallow in darkness. Which Bethel will choose,
      I cannot say.
