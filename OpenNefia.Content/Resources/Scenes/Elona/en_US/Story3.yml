    Meanwhile, at the camp of the Prince of Zanan.

  dialog:
  - actor: '3'
    text: Lord Saimore, we've arrested a strange man in the city tavern. According
      to Sir Loyter, he's the <White Hawk> that disappeared three years ago.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Are you certain?
  - actor: '3'
    text: Hah, well... There is a passing resemblance, but his appearance is drastically
      different and he has refused to answer any of our questions. I would say it's
      a different person myself, but if Sir Loyter says it's him, then I trust his
      judgment.
  - actor: '1'
    text: Changed, has he? Fufu... Of course he has. It's impossible that he'd be
      the same as he was before. Let him be. Do not harm him.
  - actor: '3'
    text: As you wish, Lord Saimore.

  dialog:
  - actor: '1'
    text: How ironic. We searched for you ever since the time you left Zanan, and
      yet only now that things have progressed so far do we finally find you.
  - actor: '2'
    text: The White Hawk of Zanan... What could you possibly expect from him at this
      point?
  - actor: '1'
    text: I expect nothing but that he shall live and bear witness to the comedy that
      shall soon unfold. Without that man, my story cannot come to a close.
