    In times long past, the land of Ylva has seen ten great civilizations,
    the ruins of which still dot the land. The scars left by the previous
    civilization, Rehm-Ido, have yet to heal. This is a story of Sierra Terre,
    the 11th era, said to be the most destructive and yet most revitalizing of them all.

    A month of rain plagued the frontier lands of Karune, and once it cleared,
    the Vindale Forest began to change. The Forest rapidly spread its roots,
    and began emanating a strange fog which created an environment
    uninhabitable by people.

    The Vindale Forest quickly overtook the land of the people of Karune,
    and refugees poured into North Tyris.

    A prince from Zanan, one of the Western countries, preaches that
    this phenomenon is the very same calamity that befell Rehm-Ido
    and advocates for the destruction of both the Heretical Forest
    and the Elean people.

    The Elea of Vindale began to retreat from human lands to avoid persecution,
    but the world's animosity towards them is still afire. The flames of war threaten
    to ignite at any moment.

    The dawn will soon arrive. You had slipped in with the cargo of the merchant
    ship Queen Sedona which was headed for North Tyris.  Suddenly you are
    awakened by a thundering roar.

    The air is alight with the sound of splitting wood as violent waves crash
     into the ship and terrible winds assault the sails. An old sailor curses his
     God and mutters:

     "It's the Ether Wind"

    ...The wood of the ship gives a final moan as the violent waves crush the hull.
    Without even time for her passengers to say a final prayer, the Queen Sedona
     is swallowed by the sea.
