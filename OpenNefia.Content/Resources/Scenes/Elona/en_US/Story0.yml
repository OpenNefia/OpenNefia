    In times long past, the land of Ylva has seen ten great civilizations,
    the ruins of which still dot the land. The scars left by the previous
    civilization, Rehm-Ido, have yet to heal. This is a story of Sierra Terre,
    the 11th era, said to be the most destructive and yet most revitalizing of them all.

    The dawn will soon arrive. You had slipped in with the cargo of the merchant
    ship Queen Sedona which was headed for North Tyris.  Suddenly you are
    awakened by a thundering roar.

    The air is alight with the sound of splitting wood as violent waves crash
     into the ship and terrible winds assault the sails. An old sailor curses his
     God and mutters:

     "It's the Ether Wind"

    ...The wood of the ship gives a final moan as the violent waves crush the hull.
    Without even time for her passengers to say a final prayer, the Queen Sedona
     is swallowed by the sea.
...
