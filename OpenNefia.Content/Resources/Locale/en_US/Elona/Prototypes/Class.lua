        Description = "The Archer. Skilled in the ways of the forest and hunting, they are master marksmen, and don't see why one should hunt monster any different than a deer. Skilled with the Short Sword, the axe, and of course all types of bows, plus a few skills they picked up on their long trips in the woods. Firm believers that Anything dead over THERE will not be bothering me HERE.",

        Description = "The Claymore. Half-human, with silver eyes and inhuman evasive capabilities, the Claymores are a mostly female class, as the males have... problems. Their weapon of choice is the Claymore, hence their name, and they prefer light armor, relying on their great speed and skills of evasion to protect them. They heal fast, but the healing comes at a price. Their bodies are unstable, their motto unknown.",

Good with a polearm from threshing grain, and good bargainers with their deals with merchants, they have working knowledge of just about every trade there is. As such, they never go hungry, as there's always something someone will pay dearly to get done. Their motto: Anything worth doing is best done yourself.",

Good with all armors, shields, divine magic, blunt weapons, and reading. The Priest is a handful, though depending on their God, they may have hidden pratfalls as well. If the motto: A hymn a day, will keep me away, Sinner! appeals to you, choose this.",

        Description = "The Thief. Good with swords and bows, though not a believer of a fair fight. Prefers to avoid taking hits if possible. Can dual wield if the weapons aren't too heavy. Years of dealing with fences have given the Thief skills with negotiating a better deal. A firm believer in the adage What's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine. See that guy over there, his stuff? Mine too.",

Oh they can fish, I'll give you that, but if you want a real challenge to build something from the ground up, this is the way to go. After all, you have to teach them everything. Only for those who have a good amount of time to spare. You can even write your own motto if you want.",

Not really a Wizard, not really a Warrior, the Warmage is a believer that stabbing things that are on fire is better than just stabbing them or setting them on fire.
