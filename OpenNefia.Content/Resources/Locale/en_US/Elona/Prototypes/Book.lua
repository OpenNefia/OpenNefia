Beginner's Guide
	Author: An Old Adventurer

<<This book is weathered and yellow
with age>

I leave this book here in the off
chance that should I not survive my
final adventure, others may learn
from my trials and tribulations.

I have lived many years and have
done many deeds. I have seen much
what this world has to offer.

This cave has been my hideaway in the
last few seasons, though if you are
reading this, it is most likely now
yours to reside in. I don't mind as
I'm either dead or faboulously rich.

Still, if you are planning on going
into the same trade as I and are not
the local scamps just playing at it,
some advice should be parted to you.

Now where to begin?

I won't know from which way you came
from so it's best to give you the
local landmarks;

If you follow the trail from here to
the South-East you find Vernis. It's
a mining town, but it should still
have some shops, a tavern and an inn.
You should be able to find some work
there, as well as food, gear, and
even a friend or two. The innslady I
recall was having some trouble with
local ruffians the last time I was
there.

East of Vernis is what the locals
call the "Puppy Cave". It's well...
always changing. A local mage called
it a "Hausdorff-Besicovitch fractal
plane", whatever that means.
If you leave the cave and come back,
or go up or down floors, it will
change all the creatures, items,
walls, and exits. You can find quite
a bit of stuff if you don't mind
hopping in and out.

The "Puppy" of this cave is fairly
deep in, and a child in town would
love to get it back, but it kept
getting itself killed when I tried.
It always reappeared on that floor
when I left and came back, but I
gave up after a few tries. Maybe
you can do it. Just don't get lost.

Once you are a bit tougher and better
geared, the Gray cave of Lesimas
might be be another good spot. It's
one of the more ancient ruins of
Nefia, and there's bound to be
something interesting in there. If
you ignore the roads, it's almost due
south of this cave.

No doubt all around the land there
will be caves and forests spawning
with loathsome critters. Just don't
go blindly into them, check them out
BEFORE going in. Preparation is a key
difference from a live Adventurer and
a dead one.
         -== Geography ==-
If you follow the roads from Vernis:
-Port Kapul is to the west. 3-5 days
  Good Business there as it's a port
  Fighters Guild and an Arena

-Palmia is to the East. 2-3 days
  Big City, lots to see and do
  King lives here
  Has Arena

-Yowyn is to the South-East. 2-3 days
  Farm Town, not a lot to do unless
  you like turnips and Harvesting.
  Note to self: Clean out Yeek's Nest
  AGAIN... worse than rabbits they be

-Lumiest is South-East of Palmia
  On an Island
  Lots of mages live there

-Derphy is South-west of Vernis
  No roads lead there
  Wretched hive of scum and villanry
  Steer clear of Dragon's Nest!

-Noyel is Far FAR to the east
  Bring a sandwich, it's a long walk
  Snow is slow going
  Don't poke the Fire Giant. Bad juju

      -== Work and Jobs ==-
While you may want to go about
slaying dragons and saving damsels,
it's best to start small. Being an
adventurer means you'll do jobs that
no one else wants to do.

Deliveries are a good way to start
out in this business. Example:
     Accept job
  -->GET THE ITEM AT YOUR FEET!<--
     Deliver item to recipient
     Collect reward
Note that forgetting the item to
deliver is very BAD, but not the end
of the world. If you are very lucky,
the local shops or fields may have
what you are looking for. They won't
know the difference, trust me.
Also note how many days you have to
deliver things. Running from Lumiest
to Port Kapul is NOT fun, and you may
simply not be fast enough yet to do
the really high paying ones.

Hunting can range from easy to very
VERY hard. The money offered is a
good way to tell how bad it will be.
Be careful doing these, as it takes
just one nasty critter to get you.

Gift getting also ranges from easy
to absurd. Just remember that if you
accept the job, running from town to
home and back takes time, and you may
not have that long to do it.

Cooking requests are only good if you
can cook, have the items, and can
deliver before the food rots. But if
you check out the local bakery before
accepting, you may just be able to
buy what you need before doing the
job.

Harvesting LOOKS easy, but it can be
very hard. Waste no time, and go as
unburdened as possible. Speed is the
key for these jobs.
Finally, try not to fail a job, it's
a black stain on your record, and too
many of those can get the guards on
you. Use you noggin BEFORE accepting
any job. Can I do it? Will I have the
time? Who gets their kid garbage on
their birthday?

      -== Advice and Tips ==-
And now a few nuggets of wisdom:

-Cargos of food are cheap, and you'll
eat them as you travel overland. But
you cannot eat them inside towns or
dungeons. If you are hungry just exit
the town or dungeon, eat, and enter.

-Be cheap. 'b'ash fruit bearing trees
in towns and fields for fruit, and
scavenge whatever plantlife you can
outside. That armor is not going to
come to you if you keep eating cakes
and pies.

-The meat of many monsters is edible.
Women love Purits flesh for what it
does for their skin. Some isn't so
good for you, but if you're hungry...

-While succulent and tasting of young
pork, the flesh of man should not be
eaten. Only crazy people eat people,
and you aren't crazy are you?

-Innkeepers for coin can feed you
quite nicely. They have beds too.

-Until you can buy/find/steal a bed
for your home, stay at inns when you
are tired. A sleeping bag is a good
idea for deep dungeon trekking.

-Should a pet or ally fall in battle,
most towns have a bartender who can
bring them back for a price.

-Check your 'j'ournal! It has all the
information about quests you are on,
jobs you are doing, events, your own
reputation and bills. Check it often.

-On the subject of bills. When you
become famous enough, you'll get a
salary of money and items twice a
month. The salary will be dropped off
in the chest in your home. However,
with salary also comes taxes. Take
the bill in hand and cash in pocket
to the local embassy just north of
Palmia and pay it there. Don't let
your bills add up as the taxmen are
worse than any dragon or demon.

-Should your skills start to plateau,
seek a trainer. There is one in every
town, and will sharpen your existing
skills. They also have skills you do
not yet possess and for a price will
teach you them. Beware though, they
only accept platinum coins, and those
are in short supply these days.

-And finally, beware the weather. Oh,
a little rain may have never killed
anybody, but with heavy rain comes
lightning that can blind you and the
great thunder which can confuse you.
Try not to get lost while in one.
Sometimes, the best thing to do is
stay in place till your head clears.
Rarely, but with increasing fervor is
the dreaded Etherwind. Beware this.
A friend of mine was stuck outside in
it and could barely be called human
when he finally staggered inside.
When it comes, FIND SHELTER! I cannot
stress this enough. Hide in a cave if
the monsters inside won't tear you to
bits. If you are in a town you are by
no means safe. Run to the innkeeper
and demand Shelter. Wait out the evil
storms, and only after it passes can
you return to your duties.







In closing, I hope this is of some
use to you, and I hope my final
adenture is a good one. Now if you
will excuse me, I have a fort to
conquer. How bad could it be?

Good luck to you and your travels.

Museum Administration Manual Mk.II
ReWritten by Curator Schmidt

So you want to run a Museum do you?

Young Sir/Lady, it takes some hefty
capital to purchase such a deed, but
if you have the time, patience, and
money this old curator will help you
out with this handy, unbiased manual.

In your wanton and overly hedonistic
destruction of the local flora and
fauna (henceforth known in this guide
as "adventuring") you might have come
across some of the following:

Item a.) Figure of <Fauna>
Item b.) Card   of <Fauna>

If so, then you may have barely given
them a glance before shoving them in
your sack if ill-gotten gains and
simply gone back to "adventuring".
No doubt you have sold them for more
tankerds of ale and legs of mutton,
but the more intelligent among you
might collect them into a pile and
ponder "Why do monsters have these?",

The answer: Vanity! And Magic!

And it is these things that we shall
profit from. And it's so simple even
an adventurer can do it!

Still, just in case, I have written
down the exact steps to minimize any
unfortunate mishaps that might arise.

Step 1.) Purchase a deed of a Museum.
   This step is what chokes out the
   small fry from the serious doers.

Step 2.) 'r'ecite the deed upon the
   spot on the world you wish your
   museum to be. Let the gnomes do
   the building, it won't take long.

Step 3.) Aesthetically place all the
   Cards and Figures you have found
   inside the musuem. Neatness is a
   virtue, though not necessary.

Step 4.) Profit!

That should do it as far as the basic
setup requires. If you want even more
information about specific queries,
merely ead on to learn more!
      -== Notes and Caveats ==-

Whilst having more than one musuem is
certainly possible, only your first
one will make any money.

Figures are worth more than cards
most times anyway.

Don't pile multiple items upon one
space. It is entirely unprofessional,
and utterly ineffectual.

The mightier the monster, the better
value the card and Figure. Rare are
the Cards with a Name or Title on
them. These indeed are best.

While having a dragon's card is nice.
having ten is just tacky. Variety is
key. The more duplicates you have,
the less they are worth.

Oh and one more thing... the gnomes
that build your musuem have somewhat,
oh, narrow tastes. you may have to
purchase a <designer board> to sculpt
it into your own grandoise vision.

            -== Errata ==-
Base cost: 		140,000 gp
Maintenance cost:    1500 gp/month
Income per rank:      100 gp/month

**Figures above are approximates only


Happy Curating!

Crimberry Addiction and You
A Schmidt Education Pamphlet

Every year more and more people are
becoming addicted to the seemingly
harmless Crimberry.

Known by an ancient Nefian dialect as
Kur-amu-beri, which should just go to
show its long and sordid history with
our land and peoples, the Crimberry
is a strong hallucinogen with many
different applications.

Simply eating a berry can cause the
following symptoms in 15 to 60mins:
- Hallucinations
- Impairment like Drunkenness
- Raving like a loon
- Fever-like motor-control failure.
Crimberry's are highly addictive, and
should the addict fail to get his
next "Crim", he will either turn to
other narcotics, or become a threat
to our community.

And of course, no one thinks of the
poor children who get involved in our
seemingly "adult" activities. They've
even created a new way to "enjoy" the
devilish berries;

They copy the wild yeeks and dry them
then shove the dried berry up their
nose. This "snorting" of Crimberries
will lead to the proliferation of
excess agression, and will lead more
desparate individuals to become known
as "adventurers" commiting insane
deeds to get their next fix.
While some of the older, long haired
Wizards demand that Crimberries remin
legalized, if only for their sacred
"rituals", this must stop!

        FOR OUR CHILDREN!

        FOR OUR FUTURE!

Blessed Herbs
Chronicled by Dr. Schmidt, PhDM

* Curaria [KYURARIA AQUIFOLIUM]
Effect is well known and medicinal.
However, the ability of said effects
is based entirely on it's so called
"consecrated" state, which has been
clinically proven to be a real effect
and not merely a placebo.
Effect Status: Life Restorant

* Morgia [MOJIA DIPSACUS PILOSUS]
Massive hormone Stimulant. Increases
muscle mass, strength and endurance.
Blind-Test subjects recieved various
"consecrated" state herbs and thusly
recieved differing returns. This only
goes to prove that Gods do in fact
exist, and that all our science is
meaningless in their might.
Effect Status: Strength and Endurance
	       enhancers

* Mareilon [MAREIRON DIPSACUS FEROX]
Neuro-Chemical stimulant. Increases
cognitive abilities. Level of effect
entirely on "consecrated" state.
Effect Status: Mental Enhancement

* Spenseweed [SUPENSUUIDO LONGIFOLIA]
All effects as of yet are unknown,
though it has been noted that those
who ingest it seem to be more "aware",
and levels of perception may be up.
More testing is needed to determine
all side effects.
Effect Status: Enchanced Perception



* Alraunia [ARURONIA MARTYNIA LUTEA]
Hormone-activated. Aphrodiasiac.
Thus extremely popular with the
locals. Oddly enough, it also appears
to have some ability at improving
memory. Research still pending grant.
Effect Status: Memory improvement,
               Libido enhancement

* Stomafilla [SUTOMAFIRIA HYPOGAEA]
Upon contact with the stomach, the
herb expands and fills the cavity,
leading the consumer to feel very
"bloated". Long term use and the
nutritional level of the plant has
yet to be verified.

Effect Status: Very Filling


As more specimens are brought in and
tested, so shall we update this brief
guide.

Until then,

Shop Owning and Operational manual
ReWritten by Schmidt the Fence

So, you think you can own a shop? I
know, sitting on your arse all day
hawking wares seems easy enough.

But then riddle me this genius:
If it's so easy, why is there only
one shop per type in every town?

The answer is simple:
      Only the strong Survive!
(Well, that and the high taxes...)

Store operation is so difficult,
only the meanest and cut-throat can
survive in town. You however, have
an advantage over us town-shops:
     You will be outside!
And while that sounds less than ideal
right now, your monthly payments to
the crown are cut down to a mere
Five Thousand Gold Pieces a Month
(5000gp/Month)
Which is peanuts to what us city
shops have to pay, believe you me.

     -== Setting up a Shop ==-
Step 1.) Buy a deed of a shop.
 (A Mere 200,000gp at a base price.)

Step 2.) 'r'ead the deed aloud on the
spot of the world you would like it
to be built on.

Step 3.) Set up the shop (see below)

Step 4.) Caveat Emptor!

     -== Running your Shop ==-
Your shop is up and now it must be
run, which is a separate process.

First you need a shopkeeper. Now this
cannot be you, as you have to out and
get the things to sell. So you have
to go and get one of your companions
to do it. You should choose a worker
based on how good they look, and how
good a negotiator they are, as they
are the vital two things in any good
sale. Now that you have such a goon,
go to the register in the shop.
Assign that person to the job.

The other part is also simple, to
SELL Stuff you need to HAVE stuff.
So go get stuff and and leave it in
your shop. The better stuff should
be out on display, the less good bits
should be in a pile in the back in
your shop strongbox.

-== Little Golden Nuggets of Info ==-

Your Salesperson stays at the shop
and cannot come with you.

Selling stuff makes money(natch) but
it also improves your rank, which can
make you even more money.

Due to a vicious spat with the local
Furniture Union, we cannot sell any
spare furniture out of town. We in
town can still buy and sell it.

Anything else, garbage, junk, even
rotten stuff can be sold if you can
find a sucker for it.

Investigate your allies to find the
prettiest and bestest negotiator. It
may be 10,000gp to do so, but having
the best salesperson available will
make up for it in the long run.

The Embassy north of Palmia sells a
fair bit of equipment for shops if
you need anything.

Due to your shop permit, you can ONLY
sell a maximum of 10 items at a time.
You can expand on this for a mere
2000gp for an additional ten slots,
and every subsequent 1000gp for each
10 slots after.


       -== Fiscal Information ==-
Base cost:            200,000 gp
Maintenance cost:     5,000 gp/month
Income per rank:      ??? gp/month**

**Why ??? for income? 'Cause that's
where you come in bub!

With luck, you too will be living
large like me!

Remember: The GP stops here!

Good Business to you!

Crop Growin' Fer City-Slickers
by Jebediah Schmidt

So you reckon on joining us good folk
in doin' an honest days work do ya?

Well, you adventurers-types with yer
big-ol' swords and fancy armor, might
not got enough grit ta get the job
done right, but we'll give you a shot
at join us humble folk.

Ta start, you need ta have a green-
Thumb, or "Gardening Skills" in your
fancy city speak. If ya don't have
that skill afore a-startin' out ya
gots a Yeek's chance on a skillet to
get any plantin' done. So go get ta
learnin' that first.

Next, since we got all the good land
near the towns, ya'll have to set up
elsewhere. Now, I could go on all day
about what my Pappy and his Pappy say
about soil, but I know you won't get
but a yeek bite's worth of it, so
allow me to "summ-ar-ize" it fer ya:

Time and Place. Them's crucial.

Ya'll might've noticed it rains more
at certain times of the year. Thems
the seasons, and the rainier it is,
the better fer yer crops.

Place is easy. You might notice we
like to plant on flat plains. There's
a good reason fer it, and ya'll soon
prolly figger out what it is. Avoid
Snow, Mountains, and the only good
thing that came from a forest is more
trees, not crops.

Now buy a deed and claim yer land.
Come Hell or High Ether it's yers!

But Jebidah, ya sez, I ain't gots no
seeds tah plant! Kin I have some o'
yers? I'd say heck no! Seeds is the
lifeblood of any crop! Go finds yer
own! Ya get seeds rarely, unless you
heads North near the Alter and finds
ya some.

Once ya got some seeds, ya needs ta
plant 'em. Now I like doin' it in the
rain, as I reckon it's better for em.
Jes stand in yer fields and 't'ool em
into the soil all gentle like. Easy.
Now, after that, ya gotta wait, as
they take time ta grow.

Thanks to that there Etherwind, crops
only take about a week or so nowadays
which gets my Pappy all in a tiff it
does, as he reckons it oughta take a
whole season like it did in his time
and his Pappy's time. Anyhoo, after
they grow and get ripe, ya gots ta
pick em. At first ya'll bumble a bit,
but once you get good enough, ya jus'
might find more seeds once ya pick em
rightly good enough.

Then ya'll go and do it again!

     -== Bits from my Pappy ==-
Now some crops'll wither, and that's
life, so no grumblin' about fate and
the winds and all that hackey-dackey.
It'll happen less if ya bless ya seed
AFORE ya go and plant it! Practice
also helps keep the wither away too.

'g'et yer crops when theys ripe, also
'g'et yer withered ones away too as
ya never know if it's a catchy sick.

Seed Types:
Fruit seed: grows them there fruits
Vegetable seed: grows them vegetables
Herb seed: Ah reckon it grows herbs
Gem seed: grow ores and gems, honest!
Unknown seed: ? Never Grew one o dese
Artifact seed: Grows Fancy artifacts

If ya needs seeds, and I know no real
farmer that dain't, ya should worship
Kumiromi. She likes her offerings all
mushy-like, and there's always scraps
ya don't need much.

My Pappy's Unca once said that if ya
'g'et yer crops in the rain it's gets
ya right better crop. Now I never was
one to go pickin' in the rain, so's I
don'ts knows fer sure iffin it's true
or not.

      -== Them Numbery Bits ==-
Deed: Bout' Forty Thousand or so
      Pends on your yackin' n' dackin
Now my Grammy, she could get a deal.
Ya shoulda seen her get TWO sacks a
Potatah's for one jug o' CrimShine.
Course', our Still was made by my
Pappy's Cousin's Unca. Still, with
Crimberries bein' frowned on as crops
ya have ta plant them all sneaky like
in the back behind squash...

You Water Wasting Jackals! Curse you!

Where I come from water is life!
Waterholes are protected to the death
down to the last woman and child!

You people, who live in such lushes,
waste so much it's sinful!

Water should be blessed, given to all
your gods as tribute! Do you people
even know all the things you can do
with dirty water?

I suspect not.

Nor will you if you simply toss it

A Ranching guide for the Greenhorns
By Cattle Baron Schmidt

Howdy all! I write this guide for the
same reason I rustle cattle about:
Money. Plenty of good royalties to be
had if one takes the time to put pen
to paper. Still, while I can't give
ALL my secrets to you as it'd put me
out of business, but I can't get you
to by my next book if I don't give at
least the basics.

To begin with, you'll at least eighty
thousand or so to purchase a deed to
a ranch. Less, if you are a good
talker or rather attractive.

Then, with deed in hand, find the
best place for it you can find. While
it cannot be within town limits, as
you do NOT want people asking nosy
questions on what exactly it is you
are breeding, or other such moral or
ethical-type dilemmas.

Once you are at the spot of choice,
merely 'r'ead the deed and claim your
land.

-== The Joys & Perils of Breeding ==-

Good Breeding is a fine art, and is
what separates us from the savages.
No where more true is this rule than
at a ranch.

Any animal assigned to be a "breeder",
will stay on the ranch, and, in time,
produce milk, eggs, shit, and other
bits. And no, I am not going to try
to explain how mammals will lay eggs
or how exactly you milk a twenty-ton
firebreathing lizard. I don't rightly
try to answer those sort of questions
and frankly, neither should you.
Just accept the fact and move on.

Now, those items can be sold for fair
coin, but the real profit is in the
breeding and rightly so. This isn't a
farm after all. Now, with the coming
of the Etherwind, breeding has become
a very simple process. Not like the
old days, when you had to keep track
of bloodlines, and breeding seasons,
and listen to the mating howls, and
the awful thumping of not one but two
Twenty-ton Carnivores going at it.
All. Night. Long.
But I digress. Now all you do is just
assign it breeding duties, and let it
be. Soon, there will be more of them.
Mitosis? Magic? Again these are the
questions you should not rightly ask.

Now, these... offspring, can be used
in several ways, which I shall list
below:

'i'nteract with it and get it to join
you on your travels.

Gene Engineering with zero risk to
the originals.

Profit by taking it to a slave trader
if, I might add, you know where to go
where no one asks any questions.

Or you can kill it and the odds of a
carcass being salvageable is much
better than duking it out in the wild

-== The Drydock. Waste Nothing ==-

A benefit of having a ranch is having
a drydock at your disposal. Now I put
mine in the southeast corner so the
wind will blow the stench away from
my estate. I assume it will be the
same for you (you'd best hope so).
In any other trade a rotten carcass
would be nothing but a loss. Not so
with a ranch, where nothing goes to
waste. Simply dump your rotten meat
into the drydock to cure, and in no
time at all you'll have delicious,
lightweight, adventurer-sought-after
Jerky!
	-== In Conclusion ==-
At this point a wise man would stop
writing here, and just let you dream.
Simply imagine the possabilities, and
then grasp them.

In my next book, which will be soon
available, I will highlight the more
subtle tricks to the trade, like how
exactly you prevent a twenty-ton,
fire-breathing, living force of
Destruction and Death from simply
leaving the ranch after setting all
to the flame and devouring you on the
spot for asking it to sit there and
breed.

Until then Partners!

You have been cordially invited hero,
RSVP not required, but come prepared.

<<This has been written on papyrus>

You have gotten a bit of a name for
yourself young one, and you are even
now growing stronger. Soon I, in my
age beyond ages, might not be a match
for you. And sensibly, I won't take
that risk later. But I do so love a
fresh challenge every now and then.

So hear this.

Seek my Pyramid! Challenge my maze!

Of course you should have a reason
more than simply my word of challenge.

How about treasure? Ah, I knew that
would do it. Within my Labyrinth lies
much treasure if you can find it. It
lies within much risk, but any reward
without risk is hollow and cold as is.

And there is what I carry as well,
though I feel it fair to warn you
that I have played this game for a
long, long time and have yet to lose.

Oh and one more thing, should you not
be properly entered within the great
Book of the Dead before entering,
those within shall ensure that you
become so, promptly indeed.

Face me if you dare!

Action! Adventure! It's Card Battles!
<<By DeckMaster Schmidt>

Have you been looking for a game that
your kids can play that doesn't
involve lawn darts, a dead yeek, and
a bit of twine?

WELL SEEK NO MORE!

Coming Soon to the Country of North
Tyris, a brand new game involving
gathering cards, duels, and bizarre
hairstyles that require exstensive
Gene-engineering to even be possible!

Sequal to the once popular game
Monster Duels, which is in turn
the sequal to Wizards & Magic!

Become the King of Games!

permits long-haul cargo. -
