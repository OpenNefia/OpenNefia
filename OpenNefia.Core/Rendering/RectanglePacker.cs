    ///     You have a bunch of rectangular pieces. You need to arrange them in a

    ///     rectangle as small as possible. This is fairly common when arranging characters
    ///     in a bitmapped font, lightmaps for a 3D engine, and I guess other situations as
    ///     well.

    ///     The idea of this algorithm is that, as we add rectangles, we can pre-select
    ///     "interesting" places where we can try to add the next rectangles. For optimal
    ///     results, the rectangles should be added in order. I initially tried using area
    ///     as a sorting criteria, but it didn't work well with very tall or very flat
    ///     rectangles. I then tried using the longest dimension as a selector, and it
    ///     worked much better. So much for intuition...
    ///   </para>
    ///   <para>
    ///     These "interesting" places are just to the right and just below the currently
    ///     added rectangle. The first rectangle, obviously, goes at the top left, the next
    ///     one would go either to the right or below this one, and so on. It is a weird way
    ///     to do it, but it seems to work very nicely.
    ///   </para>
    ///   <para>
    ///     The way we search here is fairly brute-force, the fact being that for most
    ///     offline purposes the performance seems more than adequate. I have generated a
