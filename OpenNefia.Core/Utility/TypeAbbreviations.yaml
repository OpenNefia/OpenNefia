# Config file for the abbreviations system (TypeAbbreviations.cs).
# Format should be pretty self explanatory.
# Each abbreviation has a long, a short and (optionally) a list of sub abbreviations.
# The sub abbreviations get tried if their owner passed.
# Only one abbreviation can pass in a set of abbreviations
#   (and then that passing one's sub abbreviations get considered).
