## debug
- [ ] edit game save data in one debug view

## analyzers
- [ ] data definitions must have a zero-arg constructor
- [ ] serializer strict mode
- [ ] any components with `Stat<T>` must implement `IComponentRefreshable`
- [ ] `[DataField]` types must be serializable
- [ ] `HandleableEntityEventArgs.Handled` must be checked in all event handlers
- [ ] use primitive type functions (`int.Clamp`) instead of `Math.Clamp` and similar
- [ ] prevent reserved `[DataField]` names (`id`, `type`, `events`, ...)
- [ ] component event registrations where `EventUsage` and `ComponentUsage` do not match

## mods
- [ ] visual ai
- [ ] FFHP items
